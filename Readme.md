Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Returns `true` if the object is a promise, otherwise
`false`;

### future

Lift a value into a promise. This is equivalent to `Promise.resolve`.

**Parameters**

-   `x` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any> | any)** The value to lift into a promise. This can
    either be a value, or a promise that resolves to a value.

**Examples**

```javascript

    or a promise for a value.

**Examples**

```javascript
const f = constant("Hello");
f().then(console.log); // Returns "Hello"
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** A promise that resolves to `x`.

### fmap

Map a function over a promise.

promises and returns an Array of values.

### tap

Run a function for side effect and return the original value. The original
value gets cloned and therefore can be modified in the tap handler.

    either be a value or a promise that resolves to a value.

    function can either return a value, or a promise that resolves to a value.
-   `x` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any> | any)** A value that gets lifted as the first argument
    of `f`. This can either be a value, or a promise that resolves to a value.

const p = future([1, 2]);
spread(add, p).then(console.log); // Prints 3
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** The result of applying the value of `p` to `f`.

```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** The value of `xs` reduced over `f`.

### flow

Create a function out of a list of functions, where each successive
invocation is supplied the return value of the previous function call. The
new function forms a pipe where the results flow from left to right so to
speak. It's a shortcut for composing more than two functions.

**Parameters**

-   `fs` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)> | [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)>)** An array of functions to
    compose. `fs` can either be an array, or a promise that resolves to an
    array. Each function can either return a value or a promise for a value.
-   `x` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) | any)** The argument to call the function pipeline with. It
    can either be any value, or the promise for any value.

**Examples**

```javascript
const f = (x, y) => future(x + y);
const fs = map(f, [...Array(5).keys()]);
flow(fs, 0).then(console.log); // The sum of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], returns 10
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** The result of applying `x` to the pipeline of
`fs`.

### flatmap2

The same as `flatmap`, but run two promises concurrently.

### compose

Compose two function that return promises to yield a third function that
returns a promise. The resulting composite function is denoted
`g∘f : X → Z`, defined by `(g∘f)(x) = g(f(x))` for all `x` in `X`.

**Parameters**

-   `f` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)> | [Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function))** The first function to
    compose. This argument can either be a function, or a promise that resolves
    to a function. The function can either return a value or a promise for a
    value.

    compose. This argument can either be a function, or a promise that resolves
    to a function. The function can either return a value or a promise for a
    value.
-   `x` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) | any)** The argument to call `(g∘f)` with. It can either be
    any value, or the promise for any value.

**Examples**

```javascript
const f = x => future(x + 1);
const g = x => future(x + 5);
const h = compose(f, g);
h(10).then(console.log); // 10 + 1 + 5, returns 16.
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** The result of calling `g` with the result of
`f(x)`.

This can
    either be an array, or the promise for an array.

**Examples**

```javascript
const f = x => future(x + 1);
const xs = [...Array(5).keys()];
map(f, xs).then(console.log); // Prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)>** A list of the same length as `xs`, but with `f`
applied to each of its elements.
